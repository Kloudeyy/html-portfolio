<h1>A Little More About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Steven Cornelius. I go by the name Kloudey so thats how you can refer to me. 
  I am a 23 year old self learning programmer teaching myself various coding langauges and creating multiple projects
  with the goal of landing a job in software deveopment.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to get into coding and programming for years but I either
  never got the motivation, time, or consisency to learn how to devolop code. 
  I started my path making video games in highschool but quickly fell in love with
  making music as that was what i was most passionate about at the time. 
  As the years went by I enter collage for music production to ultimately drop out the first 
  semester due to finacial troubles. Now after 5 years since then I am going back to what i wanted 
  to do and what I am passionate about.
</p>

<p>As I mentioned before my main purpose is to turn programming into a full time career path.
  Rather that be full stack web development, software engingeering, video game devolopment, or any other path,
  I plan on sticking with this for the long term.

<p>I welcome you to the beginning of the Kloudey projects arc.</p>
